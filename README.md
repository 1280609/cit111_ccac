A collection of projects and practice code for CIT111:Intro to Java
About me: I am a student who works at a full time job hoping to get a degree in cyber forensics and eventually get degrees in Informational Technology and maybe now Java coding.
I've been on computers all my life having decent knowledge in microsoft products, adobe products, and some music software.
